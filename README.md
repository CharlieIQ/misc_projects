# My Miscellaneous Projects 
All made by Charlie Mclaughlin

## About
These are many different projects, tests, and tomfoolery that I have worked on over 5 years (as of August 2023) of coding. All of the projects I've developed have made me into a pretty good programmer and these projects are a testament to that

If anyone sees this, thank you for taking the time to see what I've made. Some of the code is probably very primative and ugly, but it will be fun to go back and tweak it once I get better.

## My Top Projects
